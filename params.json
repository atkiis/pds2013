We will use the windows phone gyroscope functionalities to control the webcam of the OpenRov robot. The project will contain client application to the control camera data. We have also made a microcontroller based webcam motor to demonstrate the webcam functionalities of OpenRov.\r\n\r\nOn the serverside we use Raspberry Pi. The server to control the arduino based robot is coded with C++ and Python.\r\n\r\n[Mobile Visual Interface in use (720p)]( http://youtu.be/hz63s3-fDfI)\r\n\r\n![Robot structure](https://github.com/tikuilla/pds2013/blob/master/hardware.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Microcontroller structure](https://github.com/tikuilla/pds2013/blob/master/microcontroller_structure.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Project components](https://github.com/tikuilla/pds2013/blob/master/project_components.jpg)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

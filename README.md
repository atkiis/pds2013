Our project is to have an augmented reality style camera control for OpenRov. The application is made for Windows phone.

We will use the windows phone gyroscope functionalities to control the webcam of the OpenRov robot. The project will contain client application to the control camera data. We have also made a microcontroller based webcam motor to demonstrate the webcam functionalities of OpenRov.

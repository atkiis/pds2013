Spaceapps challenge project - OpenROV
--
Mobile visual interface (MoVisio)
==
Our project is to have an augmented reality style camera control for OpenRov. 

The client application (c#) is made for Windows phone. We will use the windows phone gyroscope functionalities to control the webcam of the OpenRov robot. The project will contain client application to the control camera data. We have also made a microcontroller based webcam motor to demonstrate the webcam functionalities of OpenRov.

On the serverside we use Raspberry Pi. The server to control the arduino based robot is coded with C++ and Python.
